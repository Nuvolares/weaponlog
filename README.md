# WeaponLog

<img width="399" height="290" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/Nuvolares/weaponlog/blob/main/Dashboard.png" />

WeaponLog is a small side project I built for myself to keep track of my firearms, range time, and training progress — and I’m sharing it here in case it’s useful to others with similar needs.

It’s a cloud-hosted web app that I run on my own server. There’s no subscription, no ads, and no commercial angle behind it.

This repository exists to explain what the project is about and to give people a place to share ideas, feedback, and bugs.  
**It does not contain the application source code.**

## 🎯 What WeaponLog Is

WeaponLog gives you one place to:

- Track firearms, ammunition, and accessories
- Log range sessions and ammo usage
- Look back at range time and usage over time
- Use the app from anywhere through a browser

It’s hosted and maintained by me, mainly because that’s how I prefer to run things and keep control over the setup.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

WeaponLog started because I couldn’t find a single tool that did *everything* I wanted.

I was looking for something that combined:
- Inventory tracking
- Range session logging
- A way to keep an eye on range time and related costs
- And eventually, insight into how my target training improves over time

There are some really good apps out there that do parts of this very well. But whenever I wanted features like **target marking, score calculation, and a clean combination of range activity and inventory**, I always ended up switching between tools.

So I decided to give it a try and build something for myself — tailored to the way I train, track, and review my progress, and running on a server I own.

WeaponLog is the result of that effort.

## 🔐 A Few Notes on Privacy & Data

I take data handling seriously, even though this is a side project:

- No ads
- No analytics
- No tracking
- Data isn’t sold or shared

The goal is to build something useful without doing anything sketchy with user data.

## 🚧 Project Status (Please Read)

WeaponLog is — and will remain — a **side project**.

I actively use it myself and will continue to improve it when time allows, but:
- There’s no guaranteed roadmap
- No promised timelines
- No professional support or backing

If there’s clear interest and demand, things *could* change over time. For now, this is something I enjoy building and maintaining alongside everything else.

## 📄 Access & Expectations

WeaponLog is offered as a hosted service so people can easily try it out.

There’s no subscription, and access may evolve as the project grows — or if it turns out there’s more interest than expected.

## 🙌 Final Note

I built WeaponLog to solve a problem I had for myself.  
If it helps you too — great.

If you have ideas or feedback, I’m genuinely happy to hear them.
